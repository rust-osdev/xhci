# Changelog

## Unreleased - ReleaseDate
### Changed
- `registers::Capability` now has read-only accessors instead of read-write ones. ([#167])
- `registers::doorbell::Register` is renamed to `registers::doorbell::Doorbell`. The former still exists, but is deprecated now. ([#167])

### Deprecated
- `registers::doorbell::Register` in favor of `registers::doorbell::Doorbell`. ([#167])

## 0.9.2 - 2023-07-19
### Added
- The sponsor button is now shown on the repository page on GitHub.

### Changed
- CI now uses `giraffate/clippy-action@` instead of `actions-rs/clippy-check` for Clippy check.

### Fixed
- `transfer::Normal`'s data_buffer_pointer calculation is fixed.
- The path to the workflow status is fixed.
- Removed an outdated lint `unaligned_references`.

## 0.9.1 - 2022-09-09
### Added
- `set_0_*` for all RW1C bits, which sets the bit to 0. This prevents the bit from being cleared on write.
- `Default` implementations for registers without RsvdP bits, which allows avoiding a redundant read.

## 0.9.0 - 2022-08-23
### Changed
- The structure of `registers::runtime::InterrupterRegisterSet` is changed, and you can now modify single fields of the Interrupter Register Set via `registers::runtime::Interrupter`. See https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci/pull/142 and https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci/pull/142#issuecomment-1222378513 for the background of this change.

### Removed
